# MEGA MORPION 3D - Groupe Python 2
POOA ISIA 2018

A [3D tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_tic-tac-toe) written in python as part of the 2018 object oriented programming course at Centralesup√©lec.

The default game size is 3x3x3, but it can go up to 9x9x9.

The game is multi-player only: you need to run two game instances to be able to play (a "server" and a "client"). The client needs to manually enter the IP address of the server to connect. If the server and the client are on the same computer, leave the default join address as it is already set to 127.0.0.1 (localhost).

# Requirements
This software project has been written in Python 3, so you need it to run the game.

The game needs pygame to run. See <https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted> for installation. Most likely, you can just do `pip install pygame`.

**requirements.txt** lists all the python modules needed for this project. Running `pip install -r requirements.txt` will install them automatically.

The game uses the port 12800 with TCP. So try to open it if it seems you can't connect to another game.

# Instructions
Clone the repository and launch main.py to start the game.
